# cwmp_antlr

Development environment for ANTLR grammer, targeted to lex/parse CWMP based on top of XML. Testing can be done inside VSCode with the use of the vscode-antlr4 extention. The goal of this repository is to define a grammer that can be used by my fork of the grammar aware (AST mutation) Superion fuzzer to fuzz client side CWMP implementations.
